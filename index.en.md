## Brief of Communicable State Machine(CSM)

Communicable State Machine(CSM) is a LabVIEW application framework that builds upon JKI State Machine(JKISM). It follows the pattern of JKISM and extends the keywords to describe message communication between modules, including concepts such as Sync-Message, Async-Message, Subscription/Unsubscription of status - essential elements for creating reusable code modules. For more information, please visit the CSM wiki: <https://nevstop-lab.github.io/CSM-Wiki/>

## Features at a glance

- :anchor: Completely inherits the characteristics of JKISM, including extensibility, string-formatted messages, and state machines mechanism
- :anchor: Decouples modules through message communication, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous messages as well as state subscription/unsubscription
- :anchor: Both synchronous and asynchronous messages support responses and handle errors that occur during execution
- :anchor: CSM Modules actually are VIs, which can be called as sub-VIs
- :anchor: CSM Modules can be used not only within the CSM framework but also in non-CSM frameworks
- :anchor: Use plug-ins to enhance parameter passing capabilities beyond just carrying string data, which is a limitation of JKISM
- :anchor: Built-in Error Handling mechanism
- :anchor: Built-in worker mode for concurrency task implementation
- :anchor: Built-in responsibility of chain mode support
- :anchor: Debugging tools
