Communicable State Machine(CSM) is a LabVIEW application framework that builds upon JKI State Machine(JKISM). It follows the pattern of JKISM and extends the keywords to describe message communication between modules, including concepts such as Sync-Message, Async-Message, Subscription/Unsubscription of status - essential elements for creating reusable code modules. For more information, please visit the CSM wiki: <https://github.com/NEVSTOP-LAB/Communicable-State-Machine/wiki>
